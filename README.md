# Bioinformatics AI/ML Research 🚀

This repository contains my work from my **AI/ML Bioinformatics Internship**.  
I focused on applying **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** for **molecular data analysis**.

## 🔬 Contents
1. **Sequence Alignment** (`sequence_alignment/`)
   - Protein sequence alignment using Biopython
   - Substitution matrices (BLOSUM62, PAM250)
   - Pairwise alignment and similarity scoring
2. **ML Models** (`ml_models/`)
   - CNN for molecular image classification (demo with CIFAR-10)
   - Random Forest for molecular feature classification (synthetic dataset)
   - SVM for gene expression analysis (synthetic dataset)

## ⚠️ Note
Due to confidentiality, **real datasets are not shared**.  
The provided code demonstrates the **workflow and methodology** using public or synthetic datasets.

## 🚀 Example Results
- CNN: ~92% accuracy (demo on CIFAR-10 dataset)
- Random Forest: ~85% accuracy (synthetic molecular features)
- SVM: ~83% accuracy (synthetic gene expression dataset)
